# Monkeybee PDF

Memory-safe, high-performance Rust PDF engine for ugly real-world PDFs.

## Why this exists

Most open-source PDF libraries choose a lane: parse, render, or generate. None of them own the full document lifecycle. The result is that real-world PDFs — malformed, quirky, hostile, produced by hundreds of different tools over decades — remain the exclusive domain of proprietary engines like Acrobat.

Monkeybee PDF exists to change that. It is a single Rust engine that treats PDFs as a bidirectional semantic substrate: not a one-way rendering stream, not a parse-and-forget pipeline, but a living document model that can be read, understood, rendered, inspected, extracted from, annotated, edited, generated, serialized, saved, reopened, and validated — all within one coherent, memory-safe system.

## The closed loop

```
open → understand → render → inspect/extract → annotate/edit → save/generate → reopen → validate
```

This loop is the thesis. Every subsystem exists to make this loop real on ugly documents. If the loop breaks — if a round trip corrupts the file, if an annotation drifts, if a save destroys structure — the engine has failed, regardless of how many individual features work in isolation.

## What v1 must prove

Monkeybee v1 is not a demo or a roadmap. It must ship with automated, repeatable evidence of the closed loop on ugly documents using a correct baseline engine.

v1 has two explicit lanes:
- **Baseline v1 (release-gating):** the smallest coherent engine that proves the closed loop on ugly documents with simple, auditable implementations.
- **Experimental backends (non-gating):** advanced algorithms, compact encoders, and specialized optimizations that remain optional until they beat the baseline under proof.

- **Rendering correctness** on hard, pathological, real-world PDFs that simpler engines mishandle or refuse.
- **Round-trip integrity**: load → render → modify → save → reload → render again, without corruption or silent drift.
- **Annotation round trips** on ugly files: add annotations, save, reopen, verify geometry and content preservation.
- **Extraction usefulness**: text with positions, metadata, structure, resource inspection, diagnostics.
- **Generation correctness**: documents created by Monkeybee render correctly under both Monkeybee and reference implementations.
- **Compatibility accounting**: every unsupported or degraded zone is explicitly detected, categorized, and surfaced — never silently swallowed.
- **Operational explainability**: the engine can explain edit safety, signature impact, and revision-to-revision deltas in a way users can act on.

## Compatibility doctrine

Monkeybee does not hide from hard PDFs. It operates under a three-tier compatibility doctrine:

- **Tier 1 — Full native support.** If a feature can be supported safely within the architecture, implement it directly.
- **Tier 2 — Safe contained handling.** If native support is not yet practical, explore sandboxed, constrained, or partial handling that preserves safety.
- **Tier 3 — Explicit detected degradation.** If support is not yet feasible, detect the situation, surface it to diagnostics, and degrade in principled, instrumented ways. Silent evasion is unacceptable.

Target categories include: malformed cross-references, broken object graphs, historical font and encoding nightmares, incremental-update oddities, encryption edge cases, transparency/mask/blend edge cases, scanned documents, CJK and RTL text, producer-specific quirks, XFA/hybrid forms (Tier 2/3), PostScript XObjects (Tier 2/3), and hostile/adversarial inputs.

## Architecture at a glance

Monkeybee is a Rust workspace organized as layered crates with explicit preservation and ownership boundaries:

| Crate | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `monkeybee` | Stable public facade: semver-governed `Engine`, `OpenProbe`, `Session`, `Snapshot`, `EditTransaction`, `WritePlan`, `CapabilityReport`, `DiffReport`, and high-level open/render/extract/edit/save APIs |
| `monkeybee-core` | Shared primitives: object IDs, geometry, errors, diagnostics, execution budgets, diagnostic streaming (DiagnosticSink), PDF version tracking, StreamHandle contract, provider traits (CryptoProvider, OracleProvider) |
| `monkeybee-bytes` | Byte sources, mmap/in-memory/range-backed access, fetch scheduler (FetchScheduler trait), prefetch planning, revision chain, raw span ownership |
| `monkeybee-codec` | Filter chains, image decode/encode, predictor logic, bounded decode pipelines |
| `monkeybee-security` | Security profiles, worker isolation, budget broker, hostile-input policy |
| `monkeybee-parser` | PDF syntax parsing, repair, tolerant/strict modes, raw token/span retention |
| `monkeybee-syntax` | Syntax/COS preservation layer: immutable parsed objects, token/span provenance, xref provenance, object-stream membership, repair records. The preservation boundary. |
| `monkeybee-document` | Semantic document graph built from syntax snapshots: page tree, inherited state, resource resolution, ownership classes, dependency graph contract, bounded cache management |
| `monkeybee-content` | Content-stream IR + event interpreter shared by render/extract/inspect/edit; consumer sink adapters (RenderSink, ExtractSink, InspectSink, EditSink) |
| `monkeybee-text` | Font programs, CMaps, Unicode mapping, decode pipeline (existing PDF text) and authoring pipeline (shaping/bidi/layout), subsetting, search/hit-test primitives |
| `monkeybee-render` | Page rendering via content events/PagePlan: positioned glyphs, images, transparency, vector graphics, masks, blending; tile/band raster surface; cooperative cancellation; progressive rendering |
| `monkeybee-compose` | High-level authoring and composition: document/page builders, resource naming, annotation/widget appearance synthesis, font embedding planning |
| `monkeybee-write` | Pure serializer: deterministic rewrite, incremental append, WritePlan classification, xref format decision rules, xref/trailer emission, structural validity, final compression/encryption |
| `monkeybee-edit` | Transactional structural edits, resource GC/dedup, redaction application, content stream rewrite pipeline |
| `monkeybee-forms` | AcroForm field tree, value model, appearance regeneration, widget/signature bridge |
| `monkeybee-paint` | Shared page-independent paint and appearance primitives reused by render, compose, forms, and annotate |
| `monkeybee-annotate` | Non-form annotations: creation, modification, flattening, geometry-aware placement |
| `monkeybee-extract` | Multi-surface text extraction, metadata, structure inspection, asset extraction, diagnostics |
| `monkeybee-validate` | Arlington/profile validation, write preflight, signature byte-range checks |
| `monkeybee-proof` | Pathological corpus harness, round-trip validation, render comparison, compatibility accounting |
| `monkeybee-native` | Optional native bridge quarantine: JPX/JBIG2/ICC/FreeType adapters, FFI audit surface, subprocess-friendly broker hooks |
| `monkeybee-cli` | Command-line interface for inspection, rendering, extraction, conversion, diagnostics |

The architecture has four explicit strata: byte/revision, syntax/COS (`monkeybee-syntax` -- the preservation boundary), semantic document (`monkeybee-document`), and content. All crates share `monkeybee-core` for primitives. The syntax layer preserves what the parser saw; the semantic layer builds meaning from it. Rendering, extraction, annotation, editing, and writeback all operate on the same document model, not parallel dead-end parse trees. Core library crates are runtime-agnostic (accept `&ExecutionContext`, never import asupersync). The facade, bytes, proof, and CLI crates are asupersync-native: session lifecycle modeled as asupersync regions, operations return `Outcome<T, E>`, budgets use the `Budget` semiring, and the proof harness uses `LabRuntime` for deterministic concurrency testing. Rayon remains the CPU-bound compute layer, bridged via oneshot channels.

## Evidence, validation, and release gates

Monkeybee's proof is automated, not rhetorical. The project maintains:

- A **pathological PDF corpus** spanning scanned docs, form-heavy files, broken metadata, transparency edge cases, CJK/RTL, huge files, malformed inputs, complex vector art, and adversarial inputs.
- A **round-trip harness** that exercises load → modify → save → reload → validate cycles.
- **Reference-guided validation** against external renderers (PDFium, MuPDF, pdf.js, Ghostscript) for differential correctness.
- A **compatibility ledger** that tracks every detected degradation, unsupported feature zone, and failure category.
- **Performance baselines** on representative hard workloads.

No feature ships without evidence. No release gate passes on rhetoric.

## Specification philosophy

This project's specification (SPEC.md) and implementation plan are designed to be exhaustively comprehensive — an alien artifact in the only sense that matters. The specification MUST only grow in detail, precision, and breadth. Suggestions to consolidate, simplify, streamline, or reduce the specification are categorically rejected. Every section, struct, contract, and narrative exists because the PDF domain demands it. Refinement means adding precision and coverage, never subtracting content. The specification targets complete coverage of the PDF problem space; iterative review rounds should ADD specificity and depth, never remove it.

## Project status

**Phase: Pre-implementation. Canonical docs under APR refinement. Bead conversion pending.**
